        <p>
            Hi my name is Jackie, I'm a 32 year old that has a passion in animal caretaking and animal loving. Ever since I was young I have always had pets in my house. The love for animals can't be questioned because they are very meaningful to me. Jackie's pet store has been open for a little over 2 years now and we have resucued and nurtured many dogs and cats. We have saved so many from terrible enviroments and have given them homes. We have been able to provide and sell food to people for great prices. Our mission is to provide food for shelters, to sell products to our customers and to help animals that are in need.
        </p>
